Agents will be able to see live tickets in the agent panel. Queue managers will assign priority tickets to the appropriate agents as well as assigning proper SLAs. It is important to note that the Queue managers may also assign the tickets to those based on expertise.

In this example we are setting the priority level of the ticket. The priority has been set to Emergency since we are dealing with an issue that can effect an entire portion of the business. We have changed the SLA plan and assigned the ticket to a top level technician. Depending on the ticketing system used, customers may set their own SLAs.
